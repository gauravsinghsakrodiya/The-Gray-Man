# The Gray Man

The Gray Man is a minimalist life-tracking website built to make time visible.

Most platforms talk about time in abstract terms. This project does the opposite.
It measures life precisely and displays it continuously, down to the second.

## What This Website Does

### 1. Exact Age Calculation
The Gray Man calculates a user’s exact age based on their date of birth and shows:
- Years
- Days
- Hours
- Minutes
- Seconds

The counter updates in real time and never pauses.

---

### 2. Life Timeline Visualization
Instead of rounded ages like “18” or “25”, the website treats life as a running timeline.
This makes the passage of time clear, measurable, and unavoidable.

---

### 3. One Goal Countdown
Users can set **one meaningful goal** with a deadline.
The site displays a live countdown showing exactly how much time remains.

No task lists.
No productivity hacks.
Just a clear reminder that time is moving forward.

## Philosophy Behind The Gray Man

The Gray Man is not a motivational platform.
It does not promise success, happiness, or discipline.

It exists to provide awareness.

When time is visible in numbers, behavior naturally changes.
This project is built for people who prefer reality over comfort.
